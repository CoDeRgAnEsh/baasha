Coming up with good product names that are marketable, unique, and memorable is

Baasha has already done the grunt work of figuring out which words make the best

## Install

var baasha = require('baasha')
```

## Examples

## API

### baasha([options], [callback(error, results)])
### baasha.sync([options])

Generate product names.

The asynchronous version will call a given callback or, if not given, return a
[`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).

The synchronous version will return results immediately.

Each product name will be returned as either a string (default) or an object
(based on the `object` boolean option). If there are multiple generated names,
an array will be returned, unless the `join` string option is given, in which
case a string of joined names will be returned.

### options

Based on [random-words](https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-words).

- `exactly`: number

    Generate exactly this many product names.

- `min`: number

    Generate at least this many product names.

- `max`: number

    Generate at most this many product names.

- `join`: string

    Call join on the results array using this string.

- `object`: boolean

    Use an object for each result element instead of a string. The object will
    have a `left` property and `right` property as strings, representing the
    word combo that makes the name.
